1. When scanf executes, the user input is saved as the type specified (%c for example) in the variable given with an ampersand preceding it (&g).
2. If we were to use scanf or printf in the functions we were calling in the main function, CalculatorRun(), there is possibility that we won't even need to call the function and then nothing would print.
3. This lab took me about a day and a half of constant working. It was not too difficult. I think the pace at which this class is going is very beneficial to actually learning the contents.
