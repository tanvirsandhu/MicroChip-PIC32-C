In this program, a user can apply mathematical operations to two operands. It reads user input, performs mathematical calculations, and then prints the results out to the user.  

The user selects an operation by typing a single character.  
The operations I have implemented are: 
    '*' - Performs multiplication on two operands. 
    '/' –Performs division by dividing the first operand by the second.  
    '+' - Performs addition on two operands. 
    '-' - Performs subtraction on two operands, subtracting the second operand from 
      the first.  
    ‘m’ – Calculates the average of its two arguments. 
    ‘a’ – Calculates the absolute value of its argument. 
    ‘c’ -  Treats its argument as a value in degrees Fahrenheit and converts it to degrees 
      Celsius.  
    'f’ - Treats its argument as a value in degrees Celsius and converts it to degrees 
      Fahrenheit. 
    ‘t’ – Takes in a value in degrees and calculates the tangent value and returns the 
      result. 
    ‘q’ – Exits the calculator run function using return. 
      
Example of the program running looks like:

Welcome to taksandh's calculator program! Compiled []

Enter a mathematical operation to perform (*,/,+,-,m,a,f,t,q): +
  Enter the first operand: 4
  Enter the second operand: 6
  Result of (4.000000 + 6.000000): 10.000000
