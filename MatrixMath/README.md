This program, given an NxM matrices, can perform any of the following operations:
  - MatrixEquals() : checks if the matrices are equal
  - MatrixAdd() : adds the matrices
  - MatrixMultiply() : multiplies the matrices
  - MatrixScalarAdd() : adds the val to all entries in the matrix
  - MatrixScalarMultiply() : multiplies the val to all entries in the matrix
  - MatrixTrace() : returns the sum of the diagonal members of the matrix (starting in the upper left corner)
  - MatrixTranspose() : returns the transpose of the matrix (flipped over the same diagonal line)
  – MatrixSubmatrix() : given two values, removes that row and column, returning a submatrix
  - MatrixDeterminant() : returns the determinant of the matrix
  – MatrixInverse() : returns the inverse of the matrix
  
The mml_test file is included to demonstrate the tests I created to ensure my program was working, and an executable file is also included.
